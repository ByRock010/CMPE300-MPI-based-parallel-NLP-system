This semester I took an online algorithms course.
Each week the instructor uploaded a new lecture video.
Sometimes I watched the lecture late at night.
After the lecture there was a short quiz on the platform.
The quiz tested whether I understood the main idea.
Every module also included a larger programming assignment.
The assignment usually had a strict deadline.
If I missed the deadline, the system reduced my grade.
Students discussed the problems on the course forum.
The forum threads helped me when I was stuck.
One assignment required implementing a graph algorithm.
Another assignment focused on dynamic programming.
For the final project we worked in pairs.
Our project explored parallel algorithms using simple test data.
We documented our collaboration in a shared report.
The instructor emphasized that real collaboration means equal effort.
We divided the tasks of coding, testing, and writing.
Near the end of the semester, the grade summary appeared online.
Seeing the quiz and assignment scores helped me plan my study time.
The feedback on the project encouraged us to keep learning.
Overall the combination of lecture, quiz, assignment, and project felt effective.
I realized that active participation in the forum improved my understanding.
Sometimes I answered questions from other students to test my knowledge.
Explaining a tricky idea often revealed gaps in my own thinking.
The course platform showed a progress bar for each module.
Watching the progress bar move forward gave a small sense of achievement.
On busy weeks I scheduled specific times for watching lectures.
Putting those times into my calendar reduced procrastination.
The instructor occasionally held live question sessions.
During those sessions students could ask about confusing topics.
I prepared my questions in advance to use the time well.
The recordings of live sessions were uploaded for those who missed them.
I replayed difficult explanations several times until they were clear.
For some units I created summary notes in my own words.
These notes became a quick reference before quizzes and exams.
The final exam combined conceptual questions and coding problems.
I practiced with old quizzes to prepare for the final.
During the exam, careful reading of each question was essential.
After submitting, I felt both exhausted and satisfied.
A few days later, the final grades were released on the platform.
The grade breakdown showed where I had improved during the course.
It also showed which topics I still found challenging.
I decided to revisit those topics during the break.
The instructor shared optional readings for further study.
Working through those resources deepened my understanding of algorithms.
The course changed how I approach problem solving in general.
Now I try to identify patterns and underlying structures more quickly.
The experience of online learning taught me to manage my own time.
It also showed that meaningful interaction is possible even without a physical classroom.
